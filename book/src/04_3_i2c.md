# I²C

## Introduction

The Inter-Integrated Circuit protocol (usually shortened to I��²C or I2C) allows multiple peripheral chips to communicate with one or more controller chips. Many devices can be connected to the same I²C bus and messages can be sent to a particular device by specifying its I²C address. The protocol requires two signal wires and can only be used for short-distance communications within one device. 

One of the signal lines is for data (SDA) and the other is for the clock signal (SCL). An I2C transaction consists of one or more messages. Each message begins with a start symbol. A message is either write or read, indicated by the next bit in the row. Following this comes the actual message in form of bytes. The message ends with a stop symbol. The clock signal rises and falls in a specified frequency.

## I2C Driver Exercise

We're not going to write an entire driver, merely the first step: the `hello world` of driver writing: reading the device ID of the sensor. 

TODO `i2c-driver/exercise/src/imc42670p.rs` is a gap text of a very basic i2c IMU sensor driver. The task is to complete the file, so that running `main.rs` will log the device ID of the driver. The this gap text driver is based on the version of the same name that lives in common, but provides a little bit more functionality.

### Driver API

#### Instance of the Sensor

To use a peripheral sensor first you must get an instance of the it. The sensor is represented as a struct that contains it address and the i2c bus. This is done using traits defined in the `embedded-hal` crate. The struct is public as it needs to be accessible from outside this crate. It's fields are private. We also implement an instantiating method. Methods can also be public or private. This method needs to be accessible from outside, so it's labelled `pub`. Note that written this way, the sensor instance takes ownership of the i2c bus.

```rust 
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct IMC42670P<I2C> {
    /// The concrete I²C device implementation.
    i2c: I2C,

    /// Device address
    address: SlaveAddr,
}

// ...

impl<I2C, E>IMC42670P<I2C>
where
    I2C: i2c::WriteRead<Error = E> + i2c::Write<Error = E>,
{
    /// Create a new instance of the IMC42670P.
    pub fn new(i2c: I2C, address: SlaveAddr) -> Result<Self, E> {

        let imc42670p = IMC42670P { i2c, address };

        Ok(imc42670p)
    }
// ...
```

#### Representation of Registers 

The sensor's registers are represented as enums. Each variant has the register's address as value. The type `Register` implements a method that exposes the variant's address.

```Rust 
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
pub enum Register {
    WhoAmI = 0x75,
}

impl Register {
    fn address(&self) -> u8 {
        *self as u8
    }
}

```

#### read_register() and write_register()

We define a read and a write method, based on methods provided by the `embedded-hal` crate. They serve as helpers for more specific methods and as an abstraction that is adapted to a sensor with 8bit registers. Note how the `read_register()` method is based on a write_read()` method. The reason for this lie in the characteristics of the i2c protocol: wW need to write a command over the i2c bus to be able to read bits in a register. Helper methods can remain private as they don't need to be accessible from outside this crate. 

```rust
impl<I2C, E>IMC42670P<I2C>
where
    I2C: i2c::WriteRead<Error = E> + i2c::Write<Error = E>,
{    
    //...
    fn write_register(&mut self, register: Register, value: u8) -> Result<(), E> {
        let byte = value as u8;
        self.i2c
            .write(self.address as u8, &[register.address(), byte])
    }

    fn read_register(&mut self, register: Register) -> Result<u8, E> {
        let mut data = [0];
        self.i2c
            .write_read(self.address as u8, &[register.address()], &mut data)?;
        Ok(u8::from_le_bytes(data))
    }
}
```

✅ Implement a public method that reads the `WHOAMI` register with the address `0x0F`. 
✅ Optional: Implement further methods that add features to the driver. Check the [documentation](https://3cfeqx1hf82y3xcoull08ihx-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DS-000451-ICM-42670-P-v1.0.pdf) for the respective registers and their addresses. Some ideas:
    * switching the the gyroscope sensor or the accelerometer on
    * starting measurements
    * reading measurements

## I2C Sensor Reading Exercise

TODO `i2c-sensor-reading/exercise/src/main.rs` is an exercise skeleton that will build. The task is to use an existing driver from crates.io to read out the temperature and humidity sensor over i2c. After that, a second sensor will be read out over the same i2c bus using `shared-bus`. The driver for the second sensor is available locally in `common/`.

`i2c-sensor-reading/solution/src/main.rs` contains a working solution.


* Define two pins, one as SDA and one as SCL. Use them to instantiate an Instance of the I2C peripheral. 

* Using the existing driver crates, make an instance of each sensor, passing the I2C instance into them. 


TODO `i2c-driver/exercise/src/main.rs` contains working code. Running it without modifying the driver file will yield errors. 

`i2c-driver/solution/src/imc42670p.rs` provides a solution to the task.
