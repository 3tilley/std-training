# MQTT Exercise Part 1: Publishing the board temperature. 

## Setup

✅ You can find a prepared project skeleton in `intro/mqtt/exercise`. 

✅ In `intro/mqtt/example_client` you can find a host run program that mimics the behavior of a second client. Run it in a separate terminal. Find more information about the example client below. 

The client also publishes messages that are only relevant for the second part of this exercise. 

❗️ Similar to the http exercises you need to configure your connection credentials in `cfg.toml` for both programs. Besides WiFi credentials you'll also need to add MQTT server details. Check each `cfg.toml.example` for required settings.

## Tasks

✅ Create an `EspMqttClient` with a default configuration and an empty handler closure.

✅ Send an empty message under the `hello` topic to the broker. Use the `hello_topic(uuid)` utility function to generate a properly scoped topic.

✅ Verify a successful publish by having a client connected that logs these messages. The `example_client` implements this behavior.

✅ In the loop at the end of your main function, publish the board temperature every second. Verify this, too.

## Establishing a connection

Connections are managed by an instance of `esp_idf_svc::mqtt::client::EspMqttClient`.
It is constructed using
- a broker URL which in turn contains credentials, if necessary
- a configuration of the type `esp_idf_svc::mqtt::client::MqttClientConfiguration`
- a handler closure similar to the http server exercise

```rust
const url = format!("mqtt://{}:{}@{}", username, password, host);
let cfg = MqttClientConfiguration::default();
let mut client = EspMqttClient::new_with_callback(url, &cfg, move |message_event| { 
    // ... your handler code here - leave this empty for now
    // we'll add functionality later in this chapter
};
```

## Support tools & crates

To log the sensor values sent by the board, a helper client is provided under `intro/mqtt/example_client`. It subscribes to the temperature topic.

The `mqtt_messages` crate (located in `common/lib`) supports handling messages, subscriptions and topics:
### Functions to generate topic strings
- `hello_topic(uuid)` - test topic for initially verifying a successful connection
- `temperature_data_topic(uuid)` - creates a whole "temperature" topic string 
- `cmd_topic_fragment(uuid)` - creates the leading part of a "command" topic (the `a-uuid/command/` part in `a-uuid/command/board_led`)

### Encoding and decoding message payloads

The board temperature `f32` float is converted to four "big endian" bytes using `temp.to_be_bytes()`.

```rust
// temperature
let temperature_data = &temp.to_be_bytes() as &[u8]; // board
let decoded_temperature = f32::from_be_bytes(temperature_data); // workstation
```

## Publish & Subscribe

`EspMqttClient` is also responsible for publishing messages under a given topic.
The `publish` function includes a `retain` parameter indicating whether this message should also be delivered to clients that connect after it has been published. 

```rust
let publish_topic = /* ... */;
let payload: &[u8] = /* ... */ ;
client.publish(publish_topic, QoS::AtLeastOnce, false, payload)?;
```

## Hints

- `split()` on a string returns an iterator. You can access a specific item from an iterator using [`nth()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.nth).
- TODO more hints here

## Troubleshooting

- `error: expected expression, found .` when building example client: update your stable Rust installation to 1.58 or newer
- MQTT messages not showing up? make sure all clients (board and workstation) use the same UUID (you can see it in the log output)
