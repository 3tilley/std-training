DESCRIBE UUID PROCESS

## Firmware
- connects to MQTT server as specified in `cfg.toml`
- sends board temperature 1x per second
- receives RGB LED commands and sets board LED accordingly

## Setup
- for the required SDK & tools, follow [general Espressif setup](https://ferroussystems.hackmd.io/gy-amApWTsK35hcUnxwXRQ#project-setup) (TODO Ferrous internal, migrate to book)
- copy `cfg.toml.example` to `cfg.toml` and edit according to your setup (do not add the `uuid` field, that will be generated by `build.rs`)

## Bonus
- try sending & processing large packets. You do not need to differentiate incoming chunks based on message ID, as at most one message will be in flight at any given time.
## Troubleshooting
- make sure both connections use the same UUID (you can see it in the log output)
